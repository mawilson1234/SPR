# Self-paced reading with comprehension questions for CGSC/LING 496/696 at University of Delaware

This is a PCIbex implementation of a self-paced reading with comprehension questions task. The experimental stimuli to be presented should be entered into `chunk_includes/stimuli.csv`. The experiment records reading times per word, question responses, response times, and condition labels for all stimuli.

`preprocess.r` is an R script that will preprocess the results from PCIbex into an easier-to-use format.

This experiment is currently used as part of CGSC/LING 496/696 (Wilson) at the University of Delaware. It is distributed under the GNU General Public License v3.0.
